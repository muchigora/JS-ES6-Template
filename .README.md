## JAVASCRIPT ES6 SET-UP

# NPM Install

- npm init or npm init –y (to install with all defaults selected)

# Babel Set-up

- Install npm packages necessary to execute ES6 code with node JS
- run command: npm install –save @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env
- Node.js does not have native support for ES6 yet, therefore installing babel, the tool that interfaces between Node.js and ES6
  In terminal / editor:
  _ Open the project directory
  _ Create a new file named:
  .babelrc \* Create this json object in that file:
  {
  "presets":["@babel/preset-env"]
  }

- How to run execute your code:
  npx babel-node filename (if in the directory of that file)

# ESLint Set-up

    • Tool that helps catch errors and stylistic flaws in your code
    • When we run it it inspects code and reveals any errors that may exists e.g., errors of mutation in code:
    	▪ Seeing in functional programming, mutation is not allowed, but arrays & objects can mutate
    • It comes in many plugins, you can implement whatever suits your needs as it can inspects many things like correct indention, checking for semicolons at the end of every line etal

Set-up:

# To install only the plugin that will detect mutation of data in arrays, objects etc where JS will allow it to happen

- run commands:
- npm install --save-dev eslint
- npx eslint --init (you can run this command directly as: npm init @eslint/config)
- answer a series of questions
- npm install --save eslint-plugin-immutable (installs the immutable plugin)
- open eslintrc.js and add some rules: add this array on top of rules plugins:[
  'immutable',
  ],
- inisde rules add this rule: 'immutable/no-mutation': 2 (the value may change: 0-disable, 1-returns warning, 2-returns error)

To check run command:

- npx eslint . (if in same directory)
- npx eslint <filepath> if in different directory
